      #   We only need to check the first element of each range of locations, mapping that back
      #   to a seed to see if we have any seed ranges overlapping with the ranges that can be
      #   translated into locations.
      #
      # To make this easier, try flattening the layers into a single layer that maps from all possible
      # seed values directly to all possible location values.
      #
      # Then start at the lowest location range, check to see if any of "our" seeds are in the range
      # we can backwards map from that lowest location range. Check the next location range, and so forth,
      # until we find a location range that overlaps with one of our seed ranges. The lowest seed in that
      # overlapping area will map to the lowest location, and the solution to the puzzle.
